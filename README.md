# hashComparisons
This is just a little python script I cobbled together that tests the speed of some Hash algorithms. We were looking at hash algorithms in my cybersec course and
they asked me to select some algorithms and comment on their efficiency. Instead of just researching, I wanted to generate my own metrics so I wrote this script.
